        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello, I am Vishnu Priya, a seasoned full-stack developer with a passion for crafting web applications using Python and React. Over the course of my dynamic career, which spans 6 years, I've had the privilege of working on a wide range of projects,
            from developing robust backend systems to designing intuitive and interactive user interfaces.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond coding, I have a life enriched by various interests and activities.
            When I'm not immersed in the world of technology, you'll often find me on the badminton court,
            where I channel my competitive spirit and stay physically active.
            I believe that sports not only keep the body fit but also nurture discipline
            and teamworkâ€”skills that are transferrable to the world of development.
        </p>
