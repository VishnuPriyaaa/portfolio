Title:
Python-Flask Portfolio Projects Manager

Description:
This Python-Flask based web application serves as a dynamic portfolio manager, showcasing my programming projects with functionality to add, edit, and view detailed information about each project. The application's front end is designed using HTML/CSS, and it interacts with a backend database to store and retrieve project information.

How to Run the Project Locally:
To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:

Execute git clone [repository-url] in your terminal to clone the project's repository from GitHub.
Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):

Run python -m venv venv to create a new virtual environment.
Activate the environment with source venv/bin/activate on Unix/Linux or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows.
Install Dependencies:

Within the project directory, execute pip install -r requirements.txt to install the necessary Python packages.
Set Environment Variables:

Set the FLASK_APP environment variable to your main application file, e.g., export FLASK_APP=app.py on Unix/Linux or set FLASK_APP=app.py on Windows.
Initialize the Database:

Run the database initialization script if provided, or set up your database schema as per the project's instructions.
Run the Flask Application:

Start the application with flask run. This will launch the server, typically accessible at http://localhost:8000.
What I Learned
In the process of building this application, I gained valuable insights and skills:

Python-Flask Framework: Gained hands-on experience with Flask for backend development, managing routes, and server-side logic.

Database Integration: Developed skills in integrating and manipulating a backend database (like SQLite, PostgreSQL, etc.) with Flask.

Front-End Development: Enhanced my abilities in HTML, CSS, and potentially JavaScript for creating responsive and user-friendly interfaces.

MVC Architecture: Applied the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern for efficient project structure and workflow.

Debugging and Testing: Improved my debugging and testing skills in a full-stack development environment.

Version Control and Documentation: Learned the importance of using version control (git) effectively and writing comprehensive documentation for maintainability and collaboration.

Please replace [repository-url] with the actual URL of your project's repository. This README provides a comprehensive guide for anyone who wants to understand, use, or contribute to your portfolio project.
