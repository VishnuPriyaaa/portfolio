Title:
Python-Flask Portfolio Projects Manager

Description:
This Python-Flask based web application serves as a dynamic portfolio manager, showcasing my programming projects with functionality to add, edit, and view detailed information about each project. The application's front end is designed using HTML/CSS, and it interacts with a backend database to store and retrieve project information.

How to Run the Project Locally:
To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:

Execute git clone https://github.com/VishnuPriyaaa/portfolio.git in your terminal to clone the project's repository from GitHub.
Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):

Run python -m venv venv to create a new virtual environment.
Activate the environment with source venv/bin/activate on Unix/Linux or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows.
Install Dependencies:

Within the project directory, execute pip install -r requirements.txt to install the necessary Python packages.
Set Environment Variables:

Start the application with python app.py. This will launch the server, typically accessible at http://localhost:8000.

What I Learned
In the process of building this application, I gained valuable insights and skills:

Python-Flask Framework: Gained hands-on experience with Flask for backend development, managing routes, and server-side logic.

Database Integration: Developed skills in integrating and manipulating a backend database (like SQLite, PostgreSQL, etc.) with Flask.

Front-End Development: Enhanced my abilities in HTML, CSS, and potentially JavaScript for creating responsive and user-friendly interfaces.

MVC Architecture: Applied the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern for efficient project structure and workflow.

Debugging and Testing: Improved my debugging and testing skills in a full-stack development environment.

Version Control and Documentation: Learned the importance of using version control (git) effectively and writing comprehensive documentation for maintainability and collaboration.
